        <p>What is so good about coffee? Well, Monday would just be a Monday, but with a cup of coffee its a
            life changer. Not only does the aroma smells amazing, but the taste is also mmmmmmm heavenly despite
            your preference of bitter or sweet. I drink coffee for the boost of energy to get through those dreading
            morning and crashing afternoon hours.
